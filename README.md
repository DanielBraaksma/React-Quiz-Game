# About

This is my solution to the final solo challenge of Bob Ziroll's React course on [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

All the code was written from scratch by myself. The task was to take a figma design mockup and create a Quiz game using React and the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/). No starter code or solutions were given.

## Features

- UseEffect hook handles API calls and reformats the data.
- UseState hook tracks state of the game.
- Conditional rendering in components to determine correct information to display to the UI.
- Functional component based, returning JSX.

## Takeaways / reflections

The advantages of working in React became very noticeable when working on this project. Letting React handle UI changes when state is changed is very efficient. This project offered a good level of difficulty and forced me to solidify my understanding of how React works. I opted to create two custom components to handle the responsibilites of A.) rendering each question component and B.) rendering the question's answer choices. I think this worked well.

I really credit the Scrimba course for it's effective teaching style. The interactive environment gives you constant opportunities to get your hands on the keyboard and code. This laid the foundation for me to be able to complete this challenge.



### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
